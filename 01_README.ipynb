    "\n",
    "<p>Noise generator (NG) is a tool for generating noise images and datacubes for Teledyne HxRG based detector systems. NG builds on principal components analysis of the James Webb Space Telescope (<em>JWST</em>) Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) detector subsystem and our experience developing Improved Reference Sampling and Subtraction (IRS$^2$; pronounced \"IRS-square\").$^1$ Although NG was informed by <em>JWST</em>, it can be used to simulate many other HxRG based systems by changing the input parameters. This executable IPython Notebook contains several examples.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The NG distribution includes the python source code, a set of default noise parameters that produce noise similar to <em>JWST</em> NIRSpec, and a collection of worked examples for <em>JWST</em> and other HxRG detector systems.</p>\n",

    "<h2>1.2 Installation and Getting Started</h2>\n",

    "<p>To get started, you should unpack this distribution somewhere in your python search path and set the shell variable NGHXRG_HOME to point to it. The distribution contains the following files.</p>\n",

    "<h2>1.3 About the Model</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The noise model is informed by our experience doing principal components analysis of the <em>JWST</em> NIRSpec detector subsystem. It includes: (1) white read noise, (2) pedestal drifts, (3) correlated pink noise, (4) uncorrelated pink noise, (5) alternating column noise (ACN), and (6) PCA-zero (also known as \"picture frame\"). In items 3 and 4, correlated/uncorrelated refers only to whether the corresponding noise component is correlated across all outputs or not. In Fourier space, the pink components are $1/f$-like and the ACN components appear as $1/f$ modulating the Nyquist frequency. In science images, ACN appears as an alternating column pattern.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Although NG includes both stationary and non-stationary components, it assumes that the non-stationary components are completely uncorrelated with the stationary ones. Our measurements suggest that this is a pretty good, but imperfect, approximation to the real situation. The practical effect is that there will be some non-flight like mixing of $1/f$-like and \"picture frame\" noise.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<H1>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</H1>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>NG was initially developed by B.J. Rauscher of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center as part of the James Webb Space Telescope (<em>JWST</em>) Project. J.M. Leisenring of the <em>JWST</em> Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) team and University of Arizona and Steward Observatory made a number of improvements including backward compatability to Python 2.x, more flexible subarrays, and speed enhancements.</p>\n",
