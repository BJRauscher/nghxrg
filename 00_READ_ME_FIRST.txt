                         HxRG Noise Generator

This directory contains the HxRG Noise Generator (NG), associated
documentation, and a preprint of a journal article (ng_ms.pdf) that
describes NG. The two README files,

  01_README.ipynb, and
  02_README.pdf,

are identical apart from the file format. If you have IPython Notebook
installed on your computer, you should start by opening the IPython
executable README, 01_README.ipynb. If not, the file 02_README.pdf has
the same content in the non-executable PDF format. To open the
executable README, please type the following.
